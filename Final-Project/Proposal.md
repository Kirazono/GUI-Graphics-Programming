Final Project Proposal

1 - Overview
For the final project I will be rendering dice (stretch goal to use different types) in fog at different distances. 
One die will be animated to move through the fog while the others are stationary to show how much level of detail they have in the fog. 
Each will be texture mapped with dice faces. The stationary dice will all be the same size and the moving one will be larger. 
As another stretch goal the user will be able to control the density and position of the fog.

2 - Steps
Wk. 1: Find models for the dice and read up on fog in THREE.js
Wk. 2: Get the fog rendered and mess around with density/position
Wk. 3: Render dice spaced equidistant along with larger die and apply textures
Wk. 4: Animated larger die and add polish where needed
Wk. 5: (Stretch goal) add controller for fog density and position, possibly add different dice

3...js
Creating a web-based application using THREE.js
